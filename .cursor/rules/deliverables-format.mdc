# Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)@5 calculated per query and averaged over all queries with the values weighted by the log_2 function.
Hotels for each user query are assigned relevance grades as follows:

5 - The user purchased a room at this hotel
1 - The user clicked through to see more information on this hotel
0 - The user neither clicked on this hotel nor purchased a room at this hotel

Submissions to kaggle for each user query should recommend hotels in order from the highest grade (most likely to purchase a hotel room) to the lowest grade (least likely to purchase a hotel room or click on the hotel).
