## Expedia Hotel Recommendation Dataset
This dataset is designed for predicting which hotel a user is most likely to book based on their search query and hotel properties. Each entry in the dataset represents a unique combination of a user's search and a hotel property displayed in the search results. [cite: 17] Entries belonging to the same user search are linked by a common search ID.
